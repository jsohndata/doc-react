# Note => React: Ideal place to store images in React Project

While it is possible to store images in the "src" or "components" directories, it's not the best practice. The "src" directory is intended to hold your React components and their associated files, such as styles and logic, while the "components" directory is often used as a subdirectory within "src" to store individual components.

Storing images in these directories makes them harder to access, as they need to be imported into your components before they can be used. This can also lead to issues with Webpack and its build process, as images stored in these directories are processed by Webpack and can increase the size of your build.

For these reasons, it's recommended to store images in the "public" folder, as it provides a straightforward and efficient way to serve them in your application. This keeps your project organized, reduces the complexity of your build process, and allows you to easily reference images in your components using a relative URL.
