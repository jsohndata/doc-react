# React: Image Bootstrap vs HTML img tag

The Image component in React Bootstrap and the <img> HTML element serve the same purpose of displaying an image on a web page. However, there are some differences between them.

React Bootstrap's Image component is a higher-level component that provides additional functionality on top of the standard <img> element. For example, it provides classes for styling the image such as making it rounded, circular or thumbnail. It also provides the ability to add overlays and captions to images.

On the other hand, the <img> HTML element is a basic HTML tag that is used to embed images into a web page. It only provides basic functionality such as the ability to set the src, alt and width attributes.

In summary, if you simply need to display an image on a web page, you can use either the <img> HTML element or React Bootstrap's Image component. However, if you need more advanced features such as styling and adding captions, you may want to use React Bootstrap's Image component.
