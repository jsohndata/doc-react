Bootstrap `<Image>` vs HTML `<img>`

The `<Image>` component in React Bootstrap and the `<img>` HTML element serve the same purpose of displaying an image, however there are some differences.

## `<Image>` React Bootstrap component
This is a higher-level component that provides additional functionality such as classes for styling the image such as making it `rounded`, `circular` or `thumbnail`. It also provides the ability to add overlays and captions to images.

## `<img>` HTML 
A HTML tag that is used to embed images into a web page. It only provides basic functionality such as the ability to set the `src`, `alt` and `width` attributes.
